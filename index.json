To answer this question, we develop a multi-sector spatial equilibrium model with endogenous land use: land is used either for agriculture or housing. Urban land, densely populated due to commuting frictions, expands out of agricultural land. With rising productivity, the reallocation of workers away from agriculture frees up land for cities to expand, limiting the increase in land values despite higher income and increasing urban population. Due to the reallocation of land use, the area of cities expands at a fast rate and urban density persistently declines, as in the data over a long period. Quantitative predictions of the joint evolution of density and land values across time and space are confronted with historical data assembled for France over 180 years.","tags":["econ","research","wip"],"title":"Structural Change, Landuse and Urban Expansion (R\u0026R @ REStud)","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Here is a set of slides talking about parallel computation on several devices, including a GPU card, using Julia.\nNotice: this was written quite some time ago (Julia version 1.0), so whatever I’ve come up here with may no longer be best practice (if it ever was).

In university teaching, we were relatively lucky because we could rely on new technologies like zoom and others to host virtual classes. In this post I’ll review my and my students’ experience over the period from September 2020 until December 2021 in this regard. What I have learned is applicable to both online and in-person teaching.\nTable of Contents Course Subjects Teaching Philosophy 1. Hands On 2. Team Work Technology 1. Materials and Accessibility 2. Communication 3. Presentation Mode Undergraduate Econometrics Courses 1. Introduction to Econometrics with R 2. Advanced Econometrics Computational Economics for PhDs Testimonials Course Subjects I taught 3 subjects over this period for the department of economics at SciencesPo Paris, as well as the department of economics at Bocconi University (where I’m on sabbatical leave 2021/2022):\nIntroduction to Econometrics with R (2nd year undergraduate) Advanced Econometrics with R (3rd year undergraduate) Computational Economics (PhD Students) The unifying feature of the three courses is that they all use a fair amount of computer code to either help illustrate core concepts (in the econometrics courses), or indeed because code is the main content to talk about (in the computational economics course). I like to think of both sets of courses as data science courses for Economists. I will first describe the overarching philosphy that guided me when designing these courses, then say a few things about technology and then describe more in detail how each course is set up.\nTeaching Philosophy 1. Hands On The main overarching idea is that working with computers and software to solve problems needs to be practiced first hand, i.e. by the students themselves. Presenting a how to do XYZ cookbook recipe on a slide has only limited value, if it does not serve as an introduction to a practical exercise where students try to actually do XYZ. To be clear, cookbook recipes, particularly if they provide a fully working example that can be executed by the student from start to finish, are valuable. In all of my courses, I try to encourage this kind of learning by doing with frequent in-class tasks, or homework assignments. Also for the final term project I much prefer to give a take home exam where small teams develop something together, rather than the typical exam format, which does not lend itself naturally to computing tasks, I find.\n2. Team Work I try to encourage as much team work as possible. It is very common that some students had more previous experience with some aspects of a task than others, and there are obvious benefits from the less experienced student of being able to follow the lead of the more experienced one. Next to acquiring the information necessary to complete a task, the student also learns to overcome a certain form of stigma which deters them from asking questions. To effectively use modern software means to be able to interact with the relevant community for help, hence, asking questions about code is a first order skill that I want students to acquire. What is less appreciated at times, however, are the benefits to the more experienced student having to explain a concept, which I think are substantial. As many teachers will be able to confirm, teaching also means to view problems from a different angle at times, which can be challenging, but rewarding. Particularly in a software-centered setting, team work is a great way to keep tooling-related frustration (the general occurence of this does not work) at a minimum. Tooling-related frustration is a big challenge for courses that involve software.\nTechnology 1. Materials and Accessibility In my view it is first order important to provide students with a one-stop solution with regards to course materials: a single webpage should host all relevant material. Online-education platforms like moodle or blackboard, for example, offer good solutions, however I personally prefer providing content via Github.com as a static website (or simply the README.MD of a code repository). I wrote a lot of code for the material of my courses, either alone or with the help of collaborators, and there is no better environment in my view than a social coding platform like github.com or other similar services, which is the main source of my preference for this over moodle or blackboard.\n2. Communication Clear and simple communication is key, in normal times and much more so in online settings. I try to stay away from email for communication with students and prefer things like Slack, or other chatroom-like platforms. Email is not well suited for discussions, as threads become unreadable and incomprehensible after several replies. Different dedicated channels in a slack workspace help to organise discussions around certain topics (for instance, the homeworks or the term paper channel), while still allowing for private messages to be sent.

How are housing characteristics priced in rental and owner-occupied markets? What can answers to these questions tell us about economic theories of homeownership? Using the English Housing Survey, we estimate a selection model of property allocations to the owner-occupied and rental sectors. Structural characteristics and unobserved quality are important for selection. Location is not. Accounting for selection is important for rent-to-price ratio estimates and explains some puzzling correlations between rent-to-price ratios and homeownership rates. These patterns are consistent with, among others, hypotheses of rental market contracting frictions related to housing maintenance.","tags":["econ"],"title":"The Housing Stock, Housing Prices, and User Costs: The Roles of Location, Structure and Unobserved Quality","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"I am getting into estimating mixture models at the moment. In particular in the context of models of wage formation where unobserved heterogeneity stemming from both firm and worker side is often modeled with a mixture model. The main assumptions are that\nFirms are classifiable into types $l \\in \\{1,\\dots,L\\}$, workers into $k \\in \\{1,\\dots,K\\}$ If Worker $i$ is of type $k$ and works for firm $l$ in a certain period, their wages are drawn from distribution $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{k,l},\\sigma_{k,l})$. This kind of model is at the current frontier of econometrics, and a recent paper is Bonhomme, Lamadon and Manresa (Econometrica 2019), ungated here, with a great replication package in R.\nThe estimation of such models often involves using the EM-Algorithm, which I won’t describe in detail here.\nWeapon of Choice? Now before getting to the full model above, I wanted to know my options in terms of programming language. I decided to benchmark a simple version of the above problem: there is only one firm type (all workers at the same firm), and there are only two worker types, $K=2$. I am considering two options in terms of language: R and julia.\nI’ll do a hand-coded version in each language, as well as use a package from each:\nHand-coding is relevant because my final problem will need some modification of existing algorithms. Packages are relevant because they often provide efficient implementations, and could be the building block on which my extension is based. Here goes!\nBenchmark Setup I will benchmark everything out of a julia session by relying on the RCall.jl package (benchmark code on this repo). RCall.jl launches an R session from within julia and allows to go back and forth with surprisingly little overhead (accesses the same locations in RAM, so no data is copied). The advantage of this is that I can create the exact same benchmarking data to test in both languages. So all code you see here is valid julia, even though sometimes it contains some R. Cool, right?🕺\nHere is the data creator:\nfunction sdata(k,n; doplot = false) Random.seed!(3333) # true values μ = [2.0,5.0] σ = [0.5,0.7] α = [0.3,0.7] m = MixtureModel([Normal(μ[i], σ[i]) for i in 1:2], α) if doplot plot( plot(m,linewidth=2), plot(m,linewidth=2, fill=(0,:red,0.5), components = false, title=\u0026#34;Mixture\u0026#34;),dpi = 300 ) savefig(\u0026#34;mixtures.png\u0026#34;) end y = rand(m,n) return Dict(:y =\u0026gt; y, :μ =\u0026gt; μ, :σ =\u0026gt; σ, :α =\u0026gt; α) end sets true mixture parameters creates a Distributions.MixtureModel data type optionally makes a plot from it draws n random realizations from it The setup looks like this:\nAll benchmarks will now proceed in the same way:\nTake vector y set (the same) wrong starting values run the EM algorithm for iters iterations to find true values of proportion weights $\\alpha$, means $\\mu$ and variances $\\sigma$ for each component. Notice that the starting values are such that the algorithm never fully recovers the true values. Given it’s the same data, however, each implementation will follow the same path for parameter values and run the same number of iterations (again, none until convergence). julia by hand Here is my relatively naive and just-copy-thy-math implemenation in julia:\nfunction bm_jl(y::Vector{Float64};iters=100) # poor starting values μ = [4.0,6.0] σ = [1.0,1.0] α = [0.5,0.5] N = length(y) K = length(μ) # initialize objects L = zeros(N,K) p = similar(L) for it in 1:iters dists = [Normal(μ[ik], σ[ik] ) for ik in 1:K] # evaluate likelihood for each type for i in 1:N for k in 1:K # Distributions.jl logpdf() L[i,k] = log(α[k]) + logpdf.(dists[k], y[i]) end end # get posterior of each type p[:,:] = exp.(L .- logsumexp(L)) # with p in hand, update α[:] .= vec(sum(p,dims=1) ./ N) μ[:] .= vec(sum(p .* y, dims = 1) ./ sum(p, dims = 1)) σ[:] .= vec(sqrt.(sum(p .* (y .- μ\u0026#39;).^2, dims = 1) ./ sum(p, dims = 1))) end return Dict(:α =\u0026gt; α, :μ =\u0026gt; μ, :σ =\u0026gt; σ) end GaussianMixtures.jl Next is a julia package written for this purpose.

Large body of evidence going back to the 60s of discriminatory practices in mortgage markets - HMDA. Extremely relevant setting: In remortgaging setting, appraiser is the single agent determining the value of property (not market interactions) - Appraiser faces no competition. This Paper: Is there racial bias in remortgaging appraisals? Approach Use property level data on remortgage appraisals, where owner’s race is observed. Infer the appraiser’s race from first and last name. Compare appraisal to output of an industry model (Automatic Valuation Model, AVM). Assess and interpret differences. Contribution Novel dataset and insights in a contentious area of debate. First paper to be able to assess impact of appraiser’s race. Found effect does not disappear with race of appraiser. Comment 1: The AVM Model It would be good to know more about this black box model. We should know what variables it uses, at which geographic scale. How well does it perform? Outcome $Y_i$ is difference between appraiser and some estimate we don’t know much about. (We know it’s a moving target.) 🤔 Why do lenders send appraisers instead of relying on the model? Comment 2: Unobserved Quality $$Y_i = \\delta_1 A_i + \\delta_2 B_i + \\delta_3 H_i + X_i \\beta + \\xi_i +\\lambda_i +\\omega_i + \\epsilon_i$$\n$X$: property type, investment properties, multi-unit properties, condominiums, and PUDs Unobserved House Quality is potentially a big issue here. Omitted variable bias could be severe. Notice that the appraiser FE does not deal with this. If avg unobserved quality of group $g$ is relatively high, we will underestimate discrimination, and vice versa. Here are a few candidates: Potentially Omitted Variables Age of property. It may be that certain groups can afford only buildings of older vintage, which could imply a lower assessment. Investments in structure, maintainance and upkeep: Less affluent groups may find it harder to make timely investments (roof, heating, insulation…), which in turn impact the appraisal. Investments in home improvement: Less affluent groups may find it harder to install winter garden or swimming pools, with the same effect on valuations. Potential Solutions A building-level fixed effect. Vladimir Avetian can use one in documenting (overt) discrimination in Moscow’s housing market. Probably hard here - unless you have a bunch of properties in a single unit? Get more data on the property to increase $X$? With current data seemingly impossible. What about ZTRAX, which has tons of characteristics (and First and Last name of Buyer and Seller), or something similar? More info on borrowers? Controlling for income (wealth better) would be ideal - education? Conclusion Very important topic. Exciting database with appraisers race marker. Getting better measures of quality and/or borrower characteristics would help.

We develop a spatial theory of demographic change and urban growth, whereby the housing market acts as an endogenous automatic stabilizer of fertility: high housing costs deter fertility while lower demographic growth mitigates future housing price increase. Our theory predicts rich dynamics of fertility and housing costs across space and time. The aging of baby boomers and their sorting across space triggers a later baby bust, more pronounced in larger cities, together with a long-lasting fertility and house price cycle that varies across locations. The predictions of the theoretical model with endogenous demographics and city growth are confronted to the data for French urban areas over the last decades.\nStatus Data Access: Confidential access data to the French Census Theory: We have a working model with joint location, fertility and housing choice. It delivers a closed form house price distribution in each city, equations for migration flows and an expression for the spending share on housing.

In this paper we test the effect of the law change on mortgage supply and demand in addition to mortgage default. Using unique mortgage loan level application and performance data, we find strong evidence that lenders tightened their lending standards in response to the law change. Particularly, lenders reduced approval rates and loan sizes for affected mortgages by about 5 percent. Households, by contrast, did not increase their mortgage applications because of the law change. More importantly, the law change did not appear to have affected mortgage default and house foreclosure outcomes. These results thus cast a cautionary note on the effectiveness of policy recommendations that intend to use deficiency laws to curb mortgage defaults.","tags":null,"title":"Recourse and residential mortgages: The case of Nevada","type":"publication"},{"authors":["admin","Robert Ford"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
