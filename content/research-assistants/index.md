title: Research Assistants

I am always looking for motivated research assistants, and I was lucky to work with people who went on to other exciting opportunities after having worked for me (see below!). 

## Minimal Requirements

Here is the list of minimal requirements that you need to master in order to be able to work for me: 

1. You know everything that is taught in [this course](/teaching/introprogramming) I teach at SciencesPo.
2. That's it. 😉




## RA Hall of Fame 🎉

Here they are! My current and previous research assistants in one place! I can only claim minimal influence in their successful careers 🤓.
