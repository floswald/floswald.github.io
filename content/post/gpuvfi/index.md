Here is a set of slides talking about parallel computation on several devices, including a GPU card, using Julia. 

**Notice**: this was written quite some time ago (Julia version 1.0), so whatever I've come up here with may no longer be best practice (if it ever was). So: use at your own risk! ðŸ˜‰
