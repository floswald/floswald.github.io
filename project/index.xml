Climate change mitigation can for example be implemented through carbon taxation on the production or consumption side, or through debt-financed public investments in emission-reducing infrastructure. Yet these various instruments may differ significantly in their cost-effectiveness in reducing emissions and in their distributional impacts among households. We develop a macroeconomic heterogeneous-agent model with environmental externalities to address both of these questions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fertility, Housing Costs and City Growth</title><link>https://floswald.github.io/project/fertility/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jan 2019 23:15:01 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://floswald.github.io/project/fertility/</guid><description>&lt;p>Developed economies moved from a baby boom to a baby bust, with very low fertility in large urban centers. We develop a spatial theory of demographic change and urban growth, whereby the housing market acts as an endogenous automatic stabilizer of fertility: high housing costs deter fertility while lower demographic growth mitigates future housing price increase. Our theory predicts rich dynamics of fertility and housing costs across space and time. The aging of baby boomers and their sorting across space triggers a later baby bust, more pronounced in larger cities, together with a long-lasting fertility and house price cycle that varies across locations. The predictions of the theoretical model with endogenous demographics and city growth are confronted to the data for French urban areas over the last decades.&lt;/p>
